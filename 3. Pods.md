# 📦 Kubernetes Pods – Detailed Notes

🔹 **What is a Pod?**
A **Pod** is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you can create or deploy.
It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.
💡 Think of a pod like a wrapper around one or more containers, along with shared resources such as networking and storage.

🔹 **Key Characteristics**

| Feature             | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Atomic Unit         | Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.                     |
| Encapsulates        | One or more containers (usually one).                       |
| Shared Namespace    | Containers in the same pod share:                           |
| – IP address        |                                                             |
| – Hostname          |                                                             |
| – Storage (volumes) |                                                             |
| Lifecycle           | Managed as a single unit (all containers restart together). |
| Use case            | Running tightly coupled apps communicating via `localhost`. |

🔹 **Why Use Pods?**

* Group containers that need to share:

  * Networking (localhost)
  * Storage volumes
* Enables tightly coupled microservices (e.g., log collector + app)
* Wrapper for container management under Kubernetes control

🔹 **Pod vs Container**

| Feature          | Pod                                    | Container                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Definition       | Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes | Lightweight process environment |
| Contains         | One or more containers                 | Only one process                |
| Created by       | Kubernetes                             | Docker or container runtime     |
| Shared resources | Network, volume, IPC                   | Isolated from others            |

🔹 **Pod Structure**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

🔗 [Docs – Pod Spec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-spec)

🔹 **Pod Lifecycle Phases**

| Phase     | Description                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pending   | Pod accepted but not yet scheduled on a node.          |
| Running   | Containers created and running.                        |
| Succeeded | Containers exited with status 0 (e.g., completed job). |
| Failed    | One or more containers exited with error.              |
| Unknown   | Node is unreachable or status not available.           |

🔹 **Pod Types**

| Type             | Description                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-container | Most common. One container per pod.               |
| Multi-container  | Used in sidecar, ambassador, or adapter patterns. |

🔗 [Docs – Multi-Container Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#multi-container-pods)

---

🔹 **Multi-Container Pod Example (Sidecar Pattern)**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: log-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myapp
    - name: log-agent
      image: fluentd
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/app
  volumes:
    - name: shared-logs
      emptyDir: {}
```

🔗 [Docs – Pod Patterns (Sidecar)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#multi-container-pods)

---

🔹 **Pod Networking**

* Each pod gets a **unique IP address** in the cluster.
* All containers inside the same pod share the same **network namespace**.

Communication:

* Between containers in a pod → `localhost`
* Between pods → via **Cluster IP**

🔗 [Docs – Pod Networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/)

---

🔹 **Volume Sharing in Pods**

* Volumes are defined at the **Pod level**.
* All containers in the Pod can **mount and access the same volume**.

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: shared-data
    emptyDir: {}
```

🔗 [Docs – Volumes in Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/)

---

🔹 **Pod Management Commands (`kubectl`)**

| Command                               | Description            |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `kubectl get pods`                    | List all pods          |
| `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`     | Show detailed info     |
| `kubectl logs <pod-name>`             | Show logs              |
| `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- bash` | Access container shell |
| `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`       | Delete a pod           |

🔗 [Docs – Managing Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#managing-pods)

---

🔹 **Pod Restart Policies**

Defined under `spec.restartPolicy`. Options:

* `Always` (default)
* `OnFailure`
* `Never`

> **Note**: Pods are **not self-healing**. Use Deployments or ReplicaSets for automatic recovery.

🔹 **Common Interview Questions**

1. **What is a Pod in Kubernetes?**
   A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes that can hold one or more containers.
   🔗 [Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)

2. **Can a pod have multiple containers?**
   Yes, for tightly coupled use cases (e.g., log agents).
   🔗 [Multi-Container Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#multi-container-pods)

3. **What happens when a Pod dies?**

   * If not managed by a controller (e.g., Deployment), it won’t be recreated.
   * If managed, a new pod will be created.
     🔗 [Pod Lifecycle Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/)

4. **Difference between Pod and Deployment?**

   * Pod: one or more containers
   * Deployment: manages pods via ReplicaSets, supports rollout/rollback
     🔗 [Deployment Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)

5. **How do containers in a pod communicate?**

   * Via `localhost`, sharing the same network namespace.
     🔗 [Networking Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/)

---

🔹 **Use Cases for Pods**

* Running single microservice containers
* Running helper + app containers (e.g., sidecar logging)
* Running short-lived batch jobs
* Serving as a backend API unit
