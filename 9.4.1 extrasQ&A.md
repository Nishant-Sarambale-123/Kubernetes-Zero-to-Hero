Here are the **interview questions with answers** for all the topics you requested: **Taints and Tolerations, Limits, Jobs, CronJobs, and DaemonSets**. Each question is followed directly by its answer, in a clear Q\&A format.

# ‚ò¢Ô∏è **Taints and Tolerations ‚Äì Q\&A**

---

### Q1. What are taints and tolerations in Kubernetes?

**A:** Taints are applied to nodes to prevent pods from being scheduled unless they have a matching toleration. Tolerations are applied to pods to allow them to run on tainted nodes.

---

### Q2. How do taints affect pod scheduling?

**A:** Pods will not be scheduled on a tainted node unless they explicitly tolerate the taint.

---

### Q3. What is the syntax for applying a taint to a node?

**A:**

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule
```

---

### Q4. What is the difference between `NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, and `NoExecute`?

**A:**

* `NoSchedule`: Pods will not be scheduled unless they tolerate the taint.
* `PreferNoSchedule`: Scheduler will avoid the node but may still place pods.
* `NoExecute`: Immediately evicts pods that don‚Äôt tolerate the taint.

---

### Q5. Can a pod tolerate multiple taints? How?

**A:** Yes. A pod can have multiple tolerations defined in its spec, each one corresponding to a different taint.

---

### Q6. How do taints and node affinity differ?

**A:** Taints repel pods from nodes unless tolerated, while affinity attracts pods to nodes with specific labels.

---

### Q7. What happens if a pod doesn‚Äôt tolerate any taints on a node?

**A:** It will not be scheduled on that node.

---

### Q8. Can you remove a taint from a node? How?

**A:** Yes, using:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key:NoSchedule-
```

---

### Q9. Scenario: You have GPU nodes. How to ensure only AI/ML pods run on them?

**A:** Apply a taint to the GPU nodes and add a toleration to the AI/ML pod specs.

---

### Q10. Scenario: Pod is evicted repeatedly. You see `NoExecute` taint. How to fix?

**A:** Add a matching toleration with `effect: NoExecute`, or remove the taint from the node.

---

### Q11. Scenario: You want monitoring pods to run on tainted nodes. What to do?

**A:** Add tolerations in the monitoring pods for the taints on those nodes.

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è **Resource Limits & Requests ‚Äì Q\&A**

---

### Q1. What is the difference between resource requests and limits?

**A:** Requests are the minimum guaranteed resources. Limits are the maximum resources a container can consume.

---

### Q2. Why should you define resource limits in a production environment?

**A:** To prevent resource starvation and ensure fair allocation among workloads.

---

### Q3. How are CPU and memory measured in Kubernetes?

**A:**

* CPU: `m` (millicores), where 1000m = 1 core
* Memory: `Mi`, `Gi`

---

### Q4. What happens if a container exceeds its memory limit?

**A:** It is terminated with an **OOMKilled** error.

---

### Q5. What is QoS class in Kubernetes and how is it determined?

**A:** QoS (Quality of Service) is based on resource requests/limits. Types:

* Guaranteed
* Burstable
* BestEffort

---

### Q6. Can you apply default limits to all pods in a namespace?

**A:** Yes, using a `LimitRange` object in the namespace.

---

### Q7. Scenario: A pod is OOMKilled. What do you check?

**A:** Check the memory limit. Increase it or optimize the pod‚Äôs memory usage.

---

### Q8. Scenario: Multiple teams share a namespace. How to ensure fairness?

**A:** Apply LimitRanges and ResourceQuotas to define per-pod and per-namespace limits.

---

### Q9. Scenario: Pod uses more CPU than requested but under limit. Impact?

**A:** The pod can burst temporarily, but during high contention, it may get throttled.

---

# üõ†Ô∏è **Jobs ‚Äì Q\&A**

---

### Q1. What is a Kubernetes Job?

**A:** A Job ensures that a pod runs to completion and retries if it fails.

---

### Q2. How is a Job different from a Deployment?

**A:** Jobs run once and exit. Deployments maintain a desired number of continuously running pods.

---

### Q3. What are the key fields in a Job spec?

**A:** `completions`, `parallelism`, `backoffLimit`, and `template`.

---

### Q4. How do you retry a failed Job?

**A:** Increase the `backoffLimit` or delete the failed job and recreate it.

---

### Q5. What is the difference between `completions` and `parallelism`?

**A:**

* `completions`: Total successful runs required.
* `parallelism`: How many pods run simultaneously.

---

### Q6. How do you ensure a Job only runs once?

**A:** Omit `completions` and `parallelism` (defaults to one execution).

---

### Q7. How do Jobs handle pod failures?

**A:** They retry failed pods up to `backoffLimit` times.

---

### Q8. Scenario: Process 100 images in parallel. How to configure Job?

**A:** Set `completions: 100`, `parallelism: 10`.

---

### Q9. Scenario: Job must run on 3 nodes. What do you do?

**A:** Split the task into 3 parallel jobs using node affinity or create 3 different Job specs with nodeSelectors.

---

### Q10. Scenario: Cleanup Job failed 3 times and stopped. How to resume?

**A:** Delete the failed Job and recreate it or increase the `backoffLimit`.

---

# ‚è∞ **CronJobs ‚Äì Q\&A**

---

### Q1. What is a CronJob in Kubernetes?

**A:** A controller that runs Jobs on a predefined schedule using cron syntax.

---

### Q2. How is a CronJob related to a Job?

**A:** CronJobs create Jobs based on a schedule.

---

### Q3. What does the `schedule` field do?

**A:** It defines when the CronJob should run, using standard cron format.

---

### Q4. What happens if a CronJob misses its schedule?

**A:** If `startingDeadlineSeconds` is set and missed, the job will be skipped.

---

### Q5. What is the use of `startingDeadlineSeconds`?

**A:** It defines how late a job can start after its scheduled time.

---

### Q6. How can you limit how many old Jobs are retained?

**A:** Use `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` and `failedJobsHistoryLimit`.

---

### Q7. Scenario: CronJob ran successfully but no output. How to debug?

**A:** Check the logs of the created Job pod using `kubectl logs`.

---

### Q8. Scenario: Need job every 15 mins but only one at a time. What to do?

**A:** Set `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid` in the CronJob spec.

---

### Q9. Scenario: Job runs 40 mins but scheduled every 30 mins. Problem?

**A:** Overlapping executions unless `concurrencyPolicy` is set to `Forbid` or `Replace`.

---

# üîÑ **DaemonSets ‚Äì Q\&A**

---

### Q1. What is a DaemonSet in Kubernetes?

**A:** A controller that ensures a pod is running on every (or selected) node in the cluster.

---

### Q2. What are common use cases of a DaemonSet?

**A:**

* Log collection agents (Fluentd)
* Monitoring agents (Node Exporter)
* Security scanners

---

### Q3. How does a DaemonSet behave when a new node is added?

**A:** It automatically deploys the DaemonSet pod on the new node.

---

### Q4. Can you run a DaemonSet on a subset of nodes?

**A:** Yes, using `nodeSelector`, `affinity`, or `taints/tolerations`.

---

### Q5. How do you update a DaemonSet without disruption?

**A:** Use `rollingUpdate` strategy in the DaemonSet update strategy.

---

### Q6. How do tolerations and affinity work with DaemonSets?

**A:** They control on which nodes the DaemonSet pods are scheduled.

---

### Q7. Scenario: You want to collect logs from every node. Which controller?

**A:** Use a DaemonSet running a log shipper like Fluentd.

---

### Q8. Scenario: Pod should run only on Linux nodes. What to do?

**A:** Use a node selector like:

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  kubernetes.io/os: linux
```

---

### Q9. Scenario: DaemonSet pods not running on tainted nodes. What could be wrong?

**A:** Missing tolerations in the pod spec. Add tolerations for the node taints.
