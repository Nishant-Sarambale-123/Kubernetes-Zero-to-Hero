# üìò Kubernetes ConfigMap ‚Äì Detailed Notes

## üîπ What is a ConfigMap?

A **ConfigMap** is an API object used to **store non-confidential configuration data** in key-value pairs. It allows you to **decouple configuration artifacts** from image content so that your applications are portable.

> üß† Think of ConfigMap as a dictionary (map) of config settings that can be consumed by Pods.

---

## üîπ Why Use ConfigMaps?

* To **separate configuration** from application logic.
* To **update app behavior** without rebuilding Docker images.
* To **reuse same image** across environments (dev, staging, prod) with different configurations.

---

## üîπ Ways to Create a ConfigMap

### ‚úÖ 1. From Literal Values (CLI)

```bash
kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=ENV=production --from-literal=DEBUG=false
```

### ‚úÖ 2. From a File

Given `app.properties`:

```
ENV=staging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

```bash
kubectl create configmap app-config --from-file=app.properties
```

### ‚úÖ 3. From a Directory

```bash
kubectl create configmap app-config --from-file=config-dir/
```

Each file inside the directory becomes a key.

### ‚úÖ 4. From a YAML Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  ENV: "production"
  DEBUG: "false"
```

Apply it using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
```

## üîπ Using ConfigMap in a Pod

You can use ConfigMaps in **three main ways**:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. As Environment Variables

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: config-env-demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "echo $ENV && echo $DEBUG"]
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: app-config
```

OR specific keys:

```yaml
env:
  - name: ENV
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: app-config
        key: ENV
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. As Files in a Volume

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: config-volume
    mountPath: /etc/config
volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: app-config
```

üîç Result: Each key becomes a file at `/etc/config/KEY`, and value is file content.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. As Command Line Arguments

You can inject values from the ConfigMap as part of the command args:

```yaml
command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
args: ["echo", "$(ENV)"]
```

---

## üîπ Data Types in ConfigMap

* All values are stored as **strings**.
* Use double quotes (`"true"`) for booleans, numbers, etc.

---

## üîπ Updating a ConfigMap

```bash
kubectl edit configmap app-config
```

Or re-apply with `kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml`.

Note:

* Pods **don‚Äôt auto-reload** changes.
* You need to restart the Pod or use a **sidecar reloader** (e.g., Reloader or kube-reload).

## üîπ ConfigMap vs Secret

| Feature    | ConfigMap          | Secret                             |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Stores     | Non-sensitive data | Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) |
| Encoded    | Plain text         | Base64 encoded                     |
| Encrypted? | No                 | Yes (optionally)                   |
| Used with  | env/volumes        | env/volumes                        |

---

## üîπ Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case                       | How ConfigMap Helps                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Switching app environments     | `ENV=dev` or `ENV=prod` via env variable   |
| Injecting config files         | Use `configMap` as volume                  |
| Dynamic tuning of app behavior | Change config without rebuilding image     |
| Central config for many pods   | Use same ConfigMap across Pods/Deployments |

---

## üîπ Debugging Tips

```bash
kubectl describe configmap app-config
kubectl get configmap app-config -o yaml
```

To see if mounted correctly:

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- cat /etc/config/ENV
```

## üîπ Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is a ConfigMap in Kubernetes?

**Answer**:
A ConfigMap stores non-sensitive key-value configuration data that can be used by Pods via environment variables, volume mounts, or command-line arguments.

---

### Q2: How does ConfigMap differ from Secret?

**Answer**:
ConfigMap stores plain-text, non-sensitive configuration data, while Secrets store sensitive information encoded in base64 (like passwords, tokens).

---

### Q3: Can you update a ConfigMap while the Pod is running?

**Answer**:
Yes, but the Pod won't reflect changes automatically unless restarted or a watcher mechanism (like Reloader) is used.

---

### Q4: How do you use a ConfigMap as a file in a Pod?

**Answer**:
Mount it as a volume. Each key becomes a file and its value becomes the file content.

---

### Q5: Can one ConfigMap be used in multiple Pods?

**Answer**:
Yes, ConfigMaps are namespace-scoped and can be reused by multiple Pods in the same namespace.

## üîπ Common Errors

| Error                 | Cause                            | Fix                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `configmap not found` | ConfigMap doesn't exist          | Ensure it's created before Pod |
| `key not found`       | Key in `valueFrom` doesn‚Äôt exist | Verify key names in ConfigMap  |
| Config not reloaded   | Pods don‚Äôt auto-refresh          | Restart Pod or use reloader    |

Would you like YAML examples of using ConfigMaps in **Deployments** or with **external configuration files** (e.g., JSON/YAML settings)?
