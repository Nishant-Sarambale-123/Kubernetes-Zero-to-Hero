Here are your detailed notes **with official Kubernetes documentation links added** for each concept, without changing or removing any existing words:

# ☢️ 1. Taints and Tolerations

## 🔹 What are Taints?

* **Taints are applied to nodes** and allow a node to **repel** pods that do not tolerate them.
* A **taint = key + value + effect** (NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, NoExecute)

> Taints ensure that **only certain pods** can be scheduled onto certain nodes.

📚 [Official Docs - Taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/)

### Example:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
```

📌 This means: "Don’t schedule any pod here unless it tolerates `key=value`."

---

## 🔹 What are Tolerations?

* **Tolerations are applied to Pods** and allow them to be **scheduled on nodes with matching taints**.

📚 [Official Docs - Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/)

### Example:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "key"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

---

## 🧠 Use Case:

* Run GPU workloads only on GPU nodes.
* Isolate critical workloads on dedicated nodes.
* Prevent noisy neighbors from sharing nodes.

---

## 🔹 Effects of Taints

| Effect             | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NoSchedule`       | Pod will not be scheduled unless it tolerates the taint           |
| `PreferNoSchedule` | Scheduler tries to avoid the node but may place the pod if needed |
| `NoExecute`        | Evicts the pod immediately if it doesn’t tolerate the taint       |

---

# ⚙️ 2. Resource Limits & Requests

## 🔹 What are they?

Used to **control resource usage** (CPU & Memory) per pod/container.

### ➤ **Request**: Minimum guaranteed resource.

### ➤ **Limit**: Maximum allowed resource.

📚 [Official Docs - Resource Management](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)

### Example:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "1"
```

---

## 🔹 Why Use Them?

* Prevent pods from using excessive resources.
* Ensure fair distribution in shared clusters.
* Avoid OOM kills (Out of Memory).

---

## 🔹 Units

| Resource | Units Example                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| CPU      | `1000m = 1 core`, `500m = 0.5 core` |
| Memory   | `128Mi`, `512Mi`, `1Gi`             |

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Set **requests** to ensure your pod gets scheduled.
* Set **limits** to prevent resource hogging.
* Use **LimitRanges** to apply defaults in a namespace.

📚 [Official Docs - Limit Ranges](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/)

# 🛠️ 3. Jobs in Kubernetes

## 🔹 What is a Job?

A **Job** is a Kubernetes controller that ensures a **pod runs to completion**.

> Once the task finishes successfully, the Job is marked **"Complete"**.

📚 [Official Docs - Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/)

---

## 🔹 Use Cases:

* Data processing
* Batch jobs
* One-time scripts or DB migrations
* Backup tasks

---

## 🔹 YAML Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: hello-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: hello
          image: busybox
          command: ["echo", "Hello from Job"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

---

## 🔹 Job Strategies

| Field          | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `completions`  | Total number of successful runs required |
| `parallelism`  | Number of pods to run in parallel        |
| `backoffLimit` | Retry limit on failure                   |

---

## 🔹 Job Status

* `Active` – Currently running pods
* `Succeeded` – Pods that completed successfully
* `Failed` – Pods that failed

---

# ⏰ 4. CronJobs

## 🔹 What is a CronJob?

A **CronJob** runs Jobs **on a schedule** (like Linux cron).

> "Run this Job every 5 minutes."

📚 [Official Docs - CronJobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/)

---

## 🔹 Use Cases:

* Scheduled backups
* Daily report generation
* Log rotation
* Data sync

---

## 🔹 YAML Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello-cron
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"  # every 5 minutes
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: hello
              image: busybox
              command: ["echo", "Hello from CronJob"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

---

## 🔹 Key Fields:

| Field                        | Description                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `schedule`                   | Cron format (e.g., `"0 0 * * *"` for midnight daily) |
| `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` | How many successful jobs to keep                     |
| `failedJobsHistoryLimit`     | How many failed jobs to retain                       |
| `startingDeadlineSeconds`    | How late a job can start                             |

---

## 🧠 Cron Syntax:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *  command to execute
```

# 🔄 5. DaemonSet

## 🔹 What is a DaemonSet?

A **DaemonSet** ensures that **a copy of a pod runs on every (or some) node** in the cluster.

> "Run one instance of this pod on every node."

📚 [Official Docs - DaemonSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)

---

## 🔹 Use Cases:

* Log collection agents (Fluentd, Logstash)
* Monitoring (Prometheus Node Exporter)
* Security agents (Falco, anti-virus)
* Storage plugins

---

## 🔹 YAML Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: log-agent
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: log-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: log-agent
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: fluentd
          image: fluent/fluentd
```

---

## 🔹 Benefits of DaemonSet:

* Ensures **uniform monitoring/logging** across all nodes.
* Automatically runs new pods when **new nodes** are added.
* Supports **node selectors**, **affinity rules**, and **tolerations** to run on specific nodes only.

---

## 🔹 Controlling Scope

* Use `nodeSelector` or `affinity` to restrict to a group of nodes.
* Use `tolerations` to schedule on tainted nodes.

---
