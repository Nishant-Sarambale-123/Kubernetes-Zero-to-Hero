# üìò Kubernetes `command` and `args` ‚Äì Detailed Notes

---

## ‚úÖ What are `command` and `args` in Kubernetes?

In Kubernetes Pod specifications, the `command` and `args` fields **override the default command and arguments** defined in the container image.

* `command` maps to **ENTRYPOINT** in Docker.
* `args` maps to **CMD** in Docker.

---

## üß† Why Override?

To:

* Run **custom scripts**.
* Change **behavior of a container** at runtime.
* Avoid rebuilding Docker images.

---

## üîç Key Concepts

| Field     | Equivalent in Dockerfile | Purpose                     |
| --------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `command` | `ENTRYPOINT`             | Sets the executable to run  |
| `args`    | `CMD`                    | Passes arguments to command |

> üìå If only `args` is specified, it overrides `CMD`, but keeps the image‚Äôs `ENTRYPOINT`.
> üìå If `command` is specified, it **overrides both** ENTRYPOINT and CMD.

---

## üß© YAML Syntax Examples

### ‚úÖ Example 1: Only using `command`

```yaml
containers:
- name: alpine
  image: alpine
  command: ["echo", "Hello from command"]
```

> This will override both `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`. The container prints the message and exits.

---

### ‚úÖ Example 2: Using `command` + `args`

```yaml
containers:
- name: alpine
  image: alpine
  command: ["sh", "-c"]
  args: ["echo Hello from args"]
```

> This runs the shell with the command: `sh -c "echo Hello from args"`

---

### ‚úÖ Example 3: Only using `args`

Assume image has:

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
```

Then use:

```yaml
containers:
- name: alpine
  image: custom-echo
  args: ["Hello", "World"]
```

> Output: `echo Hello World` ‚Äì overrides `CMD` only.

---

## üéØ Use Cases

| Use Case                               | What to Use   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Override default script                | Use `command` |
| Add extra runtime parameters           | Use `args`    |
| Change behavior without changing image | Use both      |

---

## üîÅ Example with BusyBox

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: command-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c"]
    args: ["while true; do echo Hello; sleep 5; done"]
```

> This runs an infinite loop printing "Hello" every 5 seconds.

---

## üß™ Another Practical Example ‚Äì Run Script

```yaml
containers:
- name: worker
  image: ubuntu
  command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
  args: ["./startup.sh"]
```

> Runs a shell script inside the container.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips and Pitfalls

| Tip / Pitfall                          | Explanation                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use JSON array style                   | Always use `["command", "arg1"]` not `"command arg1"`          |
| `command` overrides ENTRYPOINT and CMD | Full replacement                                               |
| `args` only overrides CMD              | ENTRYPOINT remains intact                                      |
| Debugging container behavior           | Use `command: ["sleep"]`, `args: ["3600"]` to keep pod running |

## üìö Interview Questions

### 1. **What is the purpose of `command` and `args` in Kubernetes Pod spec?**

> `command` and `args` override the default ENTRYPOINT and CMD of the container image to define what gets executed inside the container.

---

### 2. **How is `command` different from `args` in Kubernetes?**

> `command` overrides both ENTRYPOINT and CMD. `args` overrides only CMD, keeping the ENTRYPOINT intact.

---

### 3. **What happens if both `command` and `args` are provided?**

> Kubernetes runs the command with the given arguments, i.e., `command + args`.

---

### 4. **Why would you override `command` in Kubernetes?**

> To change the container's default behavior without modifying the Docker image (e.g., for debugging or custom logic).

---

### 5. **Give an example where overriding `args` is useful.**

> If a container image runs `python app.py` by default, using `args: ["another_script.py"]` will run `python another_script.py`.

## üñºÔ∏è Summary Table

| Field     | Docker Equivalent | Overrides What?             | Example             |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `command` | ENTRYPOINT        | ENTRYPOINT + CMD            | `["sh", "-c"]`      |
| `args`    | CMD               | CMD only (keeps ENTRYPOINT) | `["echo", "Hello"]` |
