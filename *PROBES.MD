Perfect 👍 — this is an **important Kubernetes interview question**, especially for DevOps roles.
Let’s go through each probe — **Liveness, Readiness, and Startup Probes** — with **concept, purpose, YAML examples, and interview tips** 👇

---

## 🧩 **1. Liveness Probe**

### 🔹 Purpose

Checks **if the container is alive** and running as expected.
If it fails → **Kubernetes restarts the container.**

### 🔹 Think of it as:

> “Should this container be restarted?”

### 🔹 Common use cases

* Detects **application deadlocks** or **hung processes**.
* Ensures **long-running apps** (like web servers) stay healthy.

### 🔹 Example:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 10
  failureThreshold: 3
```

🧠 Meaning:

* K8s will check `/health` every 10 seconds after a 10-second startup delay.
* If it fails 3 times, the pod will be **restarted**.

---

## 🧩 **2. Readiness Probe**

### 🔹 Purpose

Checks **if the container is ready to serve traffic**.
If it fails → **Pod is removed from Service endpoints**, but **not restarted.**

### 🔹 Think of it as:

> “Can this container accept traffic right now?”

### 🔹 Common use cases

* Application needs to **load data/configs** before serving.
* Database or dependent service must be available first.
* Rolling updates — avoid sending traffic to unready pods.

### 🔹 Example:

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

🧠 Meaning:

* After 5s, K8s checks `/ready` every 5s.
* If it fails → K8s stops sending traffic to that pod (but doesn’t restart it).

---

## 🧩 **3. Startup Probe**

### 🔹 Purpose

Used for **slow-starting containers** (e.g., Java, DB-heavy apps).
It checks **only during startup**, and disables **liveness/readiness checks** until it succeeds.

### 🔹 Think of it as:

> “Is the app still starting up? Don’t restart it too soon.”

### 🔹 Common use cases

* Prevents premature restarts while app initializes.
* Useful for apps that take >30s or more to start.

### 🔹 Example:

```yaml
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

🧠 Meaning:

* K8s will give the app up to `30 × 10 = 300s (5 min)` to start.
* Once this passes, liveness and readiness probes begin normally.

## ⚙️ **Probe Comparison Summary**

| Probe Type    | Checks                     | Failure Action       | Typical Use                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Liveness**  | Is app running?            | Restart pod          | Detect hang/deadlock             |
| **Readiness** | Is app ready for traffic?  | Stop sending traffic | Wait for app dependencies        |
| **Startup**   | Is app still initializing? | Delay other probes   | Slow-start apps (Java, DB-heavy) |

---

## 🧠 **Interview Tip**

If asked:

> “What’s the difference between liveness and readiness probes?”

Say:

> “Liveness ensures the app is alive — failing it restarts the pod.
> Readiness ensures the app is ready to serve traffic — failing it removes the pod from Service load balancing but doesn’t restart it.
> Startup probes delay both until the app is fully initialized.”

Would you like me to show one **combined YAML example** (with all three probes) — a realistic one for microservices running in EKS?

Good catch 👏 — I explained each probe separately above, but here’s the **combined YAML example** you can keep as notes or show in an interview.
This one demonstrates **liveness, readiness, and startup probes together** in a **real-world deployment**.

### ✅ **Full Example — Probes in a Deployment**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp-container
          image: myapp:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

          # 🟢 Startup Probe — checks during app initialization
          startupProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8080
            failureThreshold: 30   # allows up to 5 mins (30 x 10s)
            periodSeconds: 10

          # 🔵 Liveness Probe — ensures app stays healthy
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 10
            failureThreshold: 3

          # 🟣 Readiness Probe — ensures app is ready for traffic
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /ready
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 5
            failureThreshold: 3
```

### 🧠 How it works:

1. **Startup probe** runs first → allows time for app startup.
2. Once startup passes → **Liveness** and **Readiness** probes activate.
3. If **Readiness** fails → pod stays alive but no traffic is sent.
4. If **Liveness** fails → pod is restarted automatically.

Would you like me to explain **what happens step-by-step when one of these probes fails** (like readiness or liveness) — that’s often an interview follow-up?
