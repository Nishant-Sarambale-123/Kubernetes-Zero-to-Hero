# ðŸ“¦ Kubernetes Pods â€“ Detailed Notes

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Pod?

* A **Pod** is the **smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model** that you can create or deploy.
* It represents **a single instance of a running process** in your cluster.

> ðŸ’¡ **Think of a pod like a wrapper around one or more containers**, along with shared resources such as networking and storage.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Characteristics

| Feature              | Description                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomic Unit**      | Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.                                                   |
| **Encapsulates**     | One or more containers (usually one).                                                     |
| **Shared Namespace** | Containers in the same pod share: <br>â€“ IP address <br>â€“ Hostname <br>â€“ Storage (volumes) |
| **Lifecycle**        | Managed as a single unit (all containers restart together).                               |
| **Use case**         | Running tightly coupled applications that need to communicate via localhost.              |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use Pods?

* To **group containers** that need to share:

  * **Networking (localhost communication)**
  * **Storage volumes**
* Enables **tightly coupled microservices** (e.g., log collector + app).
* A **wrapper for container management** under Kubernetes control.

## ðŸ”¹ Pod vs Container

| Feature          | Pod                             | Container                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Definition       | Smallest deployable unit in K8s | Lightweight process environment |
| Contains         | One or more containers          | Only one process                |
| Created by       | Kubernetes                      | Docker or container runtime     |
| Shared resources | Network, volume, IPC            | Isolated from others            |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pod Structure

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pod Lifecycle Phases

1. **Pending** â€“ Pod accepted but not yet scheduled on a node.
2. **Running** â€“ Containers are created and running.
3. **Succeeded** â€“ Containers exited with `0` status (for jobs).
4. **Failed** â€“ One or more containers exited with non-zero.
5. **Unknown** â€“ Node unreachable, status not available.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pod Types

| Type                     | Description                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-container Pod** | Common type, one container doing one job.       |
| **Multi-container Pod**  | Used for sidecar, ambassador, adapter patterns. |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Multi-Container Pod Example (Sidecar Pattern)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: log-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myapp
    - name: log-agent
      image: fluentd
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/app
  volumes:
    - name: shared-logs
      emptyDir: {}
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pod Networking

* **Each Pod gets a unique IP** within the cluster.
* All containers inside the Pod share the **same network namespace**.
* Communication:

  * Between containers in a pod â†’ `localhost`
  * Between pods â†’ via **Cluster IP**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Volume Sharing in Pods

* Volumes are defined at the Pod level.
* All containers can **mount and access the same volume**.

Example:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: shared-data
    emptyDir: {}
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pod Management Commands (kubectl)

| Command                               | Description        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `kubectl get pods`                    | List all pods      |
| `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`     | Show detailed info |
| `kubectl logs <pod-name>`             | Show logs          |
| `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- bash` | Access shell       |
| `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`       | Delete pod         |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pod Restart Policies

* Defined under `spec.restartPolicy`
* Options:

  * `Always` (default)
  * `OnFailure`
  * `Never`

> Pods are not meant to be restarted indefinitely â€” use **Deployments** or **ReplicaSets** for that.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Interview Questions

### Q1: What is a Pod in Kubernetes?

**A:** It is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, which can hold one or more containers sharing the same network and storage resources.

---

### Q2: Can a pod have multiple containers?

**A:** Yes, usually in tightly coupled scenarios (e.g., app + logging agent). They share volumes and network.

---

### Q3: What happens when a Pod dies?

**A:** If not part of a controller (like Deployment), it won't be recreated. If managed by a controller, a new pod is created automatically.

---

### Q4: Difference between Pod and Deployment?

**A:** A Pod is a single unit. A Deployment is a higher-level object that manages **replica sets of pods**, provides **self-healing**, and allows **rolling updates**.

---

### Q5: How do containers in a pod communicate?

**A:** Via `localhost`, as they share the same network namespace.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Use Cases for Pods

* Running single microservice containers.
* Running helper + app containers (e.g., log collector).
* Running short-lived batch jobs.
* Serving as a backend API unit.
