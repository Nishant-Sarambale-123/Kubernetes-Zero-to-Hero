Perfect üëç Nishant ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **simple and interview-friendly** explanation for the **4 main EKS add-ons** (the 3 default + EBS CSI) in **easy terms** üëá

---

## üß© What Are EKS Add-ons?

Add-ons are **extra components** that help your EKS cluster work properly ‚Äî like networking, DNS, and storage.
When you create a cluster, **some are installed automatically**, but **you manage their versions yourself**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **VPC CNI (aws-node)** ‚Äì *Networking Add-on*

* Handles **networking for pods**.
* It lets each pod get an **IP address directly from your VPC**, so they can communicate just like EC2 instances.
* Without it, your pods can‚Äôt talk to each other or to the internet properly.
* You can configure it (like max pods per node, secondary IPs).

üìò Think of it as: ‚ÄúThe **network manager** for all pods in your cluster.‚Äù

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **CoreDNS**

* Provides **DNS service** inside the cluster.
* It resolves pod and service names like `backend.default.svc.cluster.local` into IPs.
* Without CoreDNS, services and pods can‚Äôt find each other.

üìò Think of it as: ‚ÄúThe **phonebook** for your Kubernetes cluster.‚Äù

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **kube-proxy**

* Handles **routing and load balancing** between services and pods.
* It keeps track of which pods belong to which service and forwards traffic correctly.
* It ensures your app traffic reaches the right pod.

üìò Think of it as: ‚ÄúThe **traffic police** that sends requests to the correct pods.‚Äù

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **EBS CSI Driver** ‚Äì *(Not default, must install manually)*

* Allows pods to use **Amazon EBS volumes** as persistent storage.
* Needed for databases or apps that must save data even if pods restart.
* It creates, attaches, and deletes EBS volumes automatically through Kubernetes.

üìò Think of it as: ‚ÄúThe **storage connector** between Kubernetes and AWS EBS.‚Äù

## ‚öôÔ∏è Summary Table

| Add-on             | Purpose                          | Default Installed? | What It Manages     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **VPC CNI**        | Pod networking & IPs             | ‚úÖ Yes              | Networking          |
| **CoreDNS**        | DNS resolution inside cluster    | ‚úÖ Yes              | Service name lookup |
| **kube-proxy**     | Routing & service traffic        | ‚úÖ Yes              | Traffic forwarding  |
| **EBS CSI Driver** | Persistent storage (EBS volumes) | ‚ùå No               | Volumes & storage   |

‚úÖ **In short answer (for interview):**

> ‚ÄúIn EKS, default add-ons like VPC CNI, CoreDNS, and kube-proxy handle networking, DNS, and service routing.
> We also use the EBS CSI driver when we need persistent storage for stateful workloads.
> These add-ons make the cluster fully functional ‚Äî networking, service discovery, and storage all work through them.‚Äù

Would you like me to add a **YAML example** showing how to install the **EBS CSI driver** using `eksctl` or a `kustomize` manifest (for explanation in interview)?
