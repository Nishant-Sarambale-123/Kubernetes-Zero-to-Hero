## üîç **Kubernetes Logging Levels: Overview**

In Kubernetes, logging levels control the **verbosity** of log output from system components (like kubelet, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, etc.). These logging levels are particularly useful for **debugging, auditing, or performance tuning**.

Logging in Kubernetes uses a **verbosity level system** from `0` (least verbose) to `10` (most verbose). These levels are configured using the `-v` flag.

## üìò **Kubernetes Logging Levels Explained**

| Level  | Name               | Description                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`    | **Fatal**          | Only critical messages that cause the process to crash.                   |
| `1`    | **Normal / Info**  | General operational logs ‚Äì what you see by default.                       |
| `2`    | **Important Info** | More detailed information about the running components.                   |
| `3`    | **Debug**          | Debug-level messages, helpful for understanding decision making.          |
| `4`    | **Extended Debug** | Deeper insight into controller logic and event handling.                  |
| `5`    | **Trace**          | Traces code execution paths ‚Äì used to diagnose problems.                  |
| `6-10` | **Highly Verbose** | Extremely detailed internal logs; usually for Kubernetes developers only. |

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Set Logging Level in Kubernetes**

You can set the verbosity level using the `-v` flag in a Kubernetes component:

```bash
kubelet -v=3
kube-apiserver -v=4
```

This is usually done in the **manifest files** in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`.

---

## üéØ **Example Use Cases for Logging Levels**

| Scenario              | Logging Level     |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Production monitoring | `-v=1`            |
| Debugging an issue    | `-v=3` or `-v=4`  |
| Tracing API calls     | `-v=5`            |
| Development testing   | `-v=6` to `-v=10` |

## üìÇ **Kubernetes Component Logging Example**

### kube-apiserver:

```bash
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
```

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kube-apiserver
    command:
    - kube-apiserver
    - --v=3
```

### kubelet:

```bash
kubelet --v=4
```

This sets the kubelet‚Äôs verbosity level to 4.

## üß† **Interview Questions & Answers**

### 1. **What are the different logging levels in Kubernetes?**

**Answer:** Kubernetes supports logging levels from 0 to 10, where:

* `0`: Fatal errors
* `1`: General operational info
* `2-4`: Increasingly detailed debug info
* `5-10`: Highly verbose tracing for developers

---

### 2. **Which logging level is default in Kubernetes?**

**Answer:** The default logging level is `-v=1`.

---

### 3. **When would you use `-v=4` logging level?**

**Answer:** When you need **extended debug information**, such as controller decisions and internal events, without the overwhelming detail of full tracing.

---

### 4. **How do you change the logging level of a Kubernetes component like kube-apiserver?**

**Answer:** You edit the component's manifest file (e.g., `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`) and set the `--v` flag to the desired level.

---

### 5. **Can you dynamically change the logging level at runtime?**

**Answer:** No, logging levels are set at component startup. You must **restart the component** after changing the logging level.

---

### 6. **What logging level would you use in production and why?**

**Answer:** Typically, `-v=1` or `-v=2` is used in production to avoid performance overhead and log clutter, while still capturing important operational data.

---

### 7. **Why should you avoid high logging levels like `-v=9` in production?**

**Answer:** They generate a huge volume of logs, which can consume disk space, degrade performance, and make it harder to identify relevant information.

---

### 8. **Where are logs stored in Kubernetes?**

**Answer:**

* Node-level logs: `/var/log/` directory (e.g., `/var/log/kubelet.log`)
* Container logs: `/var/log/pods/` or accessed via `kubectl logs`
* Logs from control plane components: `/var/log/containers/` (if using static pods)

---

### 9. **What logging solution would you integrate with Kubernetes for better visibility?**

**Answer:** Use tools like:

* **Fluentd**
* **Elasticsearch + Kibana (EFK stack)**
* **Loki + Grafana**
* **Logstash**

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* Logging level is controlled using the `-v` flag (`0` to `10`).
* Lower numbers = critical messages; higher numbers = more detailed logs.
* Default is `-v=1`.
* Useful for debugging (`-v=3/4`) and deep trace analysis (`-v=6+`).
* Change requires restart of the component.
