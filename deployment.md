# 📘 Kubernetes Deployment – Detailed Notes

---

## ✅ **What is a Deployment?**

A **Deployment** in Kubernetes is a higher-level controller that manages **ReplicaSets**, which in turn manage **Pods**. It provides **declarative updates** to applications, ensuring **scalability**, **self-healing**, **rollbacks**, and **rolling updates**.

---

## 🎯 **Primary Objectives of a Deployment**

| Feature                 | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Declarative Updates** | You declare the desired state, and Kubernetes makes it happen. |
| **Self-healing**        | Recreates failed or deleted pods automatically.                |
| **Scaling**             | Easily scale up/down replicas.                                 |
| **Rolling Updates**     | Update the application without downtime.                       |
| **Rollback Support**    | Rollback to the previous stable version.                       |

---

## 🧩 **Deployment YAML Structure**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Explanation:

* `replicas`: Number of pod replicas to maintain.
* `selector`: How to identify pods managed by the deployment.
* `template`: Pod specification to create new pods.

---

## 🔁 **Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pods**

```plaintext
Deployment
   ↓
ReplicaSet
   ↓
Pods
```

> 🧠 Deployment creates and manages ReplicaSets, which manage Pods.

---

## 🔄 **Rolling Updates**

When you update the pod template (e.g., change image), Deployment:

1. Creates a **new ReplicaSet**.
2. Gradually scales **up the new RS** and **scales down the old one**.
3. Ensures zero downtime during updates.

### Example (update image):

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.22
```

---

## 🔁 **Rollback a Deployment**

You can rollback to the previous stable version using:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```

Check revision history:

```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
```

---

## 📈 **Scale a Deployment**

Change the replica count:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=5
```

---

## 📊 **Deployment Strategy**

Default: `RollingUpdate`

```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 1
    maxSurge: 1
```

* `maxUnavailable`: Number of pods that can be unavailable during update.
* `maxSurge`: Extra pods that can be created temporarily during update.

---

## ⚙️ **Useful Deployment Commands**

| Command                                    | Description            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `kubectl get deployments`                  | List all deployments   |
| `kubectl describe deployment <name>`       | View detailed info     |
| `kubectl rollout status deployment/<name>` | Check rollout status   |
| `kubectl delete deployment <name>`         | Delete the deployment  |
| `kubectl edit deployment <name>`           | Edit deployment live   |
| `kubectl replace -f <file.yaml>`           | Apply updates via file |

---

## ❌ **If Deployment Fails**

* `kubectl rollout status` will show the failure.
* Use `kubectl describe deployment` to see the reason.
* Fix the issue and update the deployment again.

---

## ✅ **Benefits of Deployment**

| Feature      | Benefit                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Declarative  | Easy to define and reproduce       |
| Scalable     | Horizontal scaling supported       |
| Safe Updates | Rolling updates prevent downtime   |
| Revertible   | Can rollback to previous revision  |
| Self-healing | Automatically replaces failed pods |

---

## 📘 **Real-World Use Cases**

* Web servers (e.g., NGINX, Apache)
* Application microservices
* Stateless apps (preferred over StatefulSet)
* Load-balanced frontend apps

---

## ❓ **Deployment vs ReplicaSet vs Pod**

| Aspect          | Deployment  | ReplicaSet | Pod        |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Abstraction     | High-level  | Medium     | Low-level  |
| Manages         | ReplicaSets | Pods       | Containers |
| Auto-healing    | ✅           | ✅          | ❌          |
| Rolling Updates | ✅           | ❌          | ❌          |
| Rollbacks       | ✅           | ❌          | ❌          |

## 🧠 **Interview Questions**

### 1. What is a Deployment in Kubernetes?

> A Deployment is a higher-level controller that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods.

---

### 2. How does a Deployment perform rolling updates?

> It creates a new ReplicaSet and gradually increases its replicas while decreasing the old one, maintaining availability.

---

### 3. How do you rollback a Deployment?

> `kubectl rollout undo deployment/<name>`

---

### 4. What is the default update strategy in Deployment?

> `RollingUpdate` – updates pods gradually to prevent downtime.

---

### 5. What happens when you scale a Deployment?

> Kubernetes adjusts the number of replicas in the underlying ReplicaSet accordingly.
