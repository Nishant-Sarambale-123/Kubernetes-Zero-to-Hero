## üî∑ What is a Kubernetes Service?

A **Service** in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a **logical set of Pods** and a **policy to access them**. It provides **network connectivity** to Pods regardless of their IPs changing.

üìå **Problem Solved**:
Pods are **ephemeral**. Their IPs change when they restart. Services provide a **stable endpoint** to access dynamic Pods.

---

## üîß Why Do We Need Services?

### Scenario:

Suppose you deploy 3 replicas of an app (i.e., 3 Pods), each having its own IP. A frontend app wants to talk to the backend. How will it reach the backend Pods? What if Pods die and new ones come up with new IPs?

‚úÖ **Solution**: A **Service** abstracts this Pod group and provides a **single stable IP/DNS name**.

---

## üß± Basic Service Architecture

```
+-------------------+        +------------+
| Service (ClusterIP)| ----> | Pod: App 1 |
| IP: 10.0.0.1      | ----> | Pod: App 2 |
+-------------------+        | Pod: App 3 |
         |                   +------------+
      Exposes
    Pod group via
       label selector
```

## üî∏ Core Components

| Component             | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Label Selector**    | Selects Pods matching labels.                                           |
| **Endpoints**         | List of Pod IPs selected.                                               |
| **ClusterIP**         | Stable virtual IP for the service.                                      |
| **Service Name**      | Used for DNS resolution (e.g., `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`). |
| **Port & TargetPort** | Port: exposed by service, TargetPort: container's port.                 |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Service YAML Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80          # Exposed port
      targetPort: 8080  # Container port
  type: ClusterIP
```

---

## üì¶ Types of Kubernetes Services

| Type                    | Use Case                              | IP Scope       | Exposes to |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| **ClusterIP** (default) | Internal app communication            | Cluster only   | Internal   |
| **NodePort**            | External access via `<NodeIP>:<Port>` | Node IPs       | External   |
| **LoadBalancer**        | External with cloud load balancer     | Public/Private | External   |
| **ExternalName**        | Maps service to DNS                   | DNS name       | External   |
| **Headless Service**    | No cluster IP, direct Pod access      | N/A            | Internal   |

---

### 1. üîπ ClusterIP

* Default type
* Accessible only **inside** the cluster

```yaml
type: ClusterIP
```

üîß DNS Example:

```bash
curl http://my-service
curl http://my-service.default.svc.cluster.local
```

---

### 2. üî∏ NodePort

* Opens a static port on **each Node**
* Access from **outside** using `NodeIP:NodePort`

```yaml
type: NodePort
ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 30007  # Must be in 30000-32767
```

üîß Usage:

```bash
curl http://<NodeIP>:30007
```

---

### 3. üî∏ LoadBalancer

* Allocates a **cloud provider Load Balancer** (e.g., AWS ELB, Azure LB)
* **Externally accessible**, uses NodePort & ClusterIP internally

```yaml
type: LoadBalancer
```

üîß Example with external DNS/IP:

```bash
curl http://<EXTERNAL-LB-IP>
```

---

### 4. üîπ ExternalName

* Points a Kubernetes service to an **external DNS name**
* No selector, no IP

```yaml
type: ExternalName
externalName: api.example.com
```

DNS resolves `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local` ‚ûù `api.example.com`

---

### 5. üî∏ Headless Service

* No ClusterIP (`clusterIP: None`)
* Used for:

  * StatefulSets
  * Direct Pod access (for DNS service discovery)

```yaml
clusterIP: None
```

üîß Example DNS Query:

```bash
dig my-service.default.svc.cluster.local
# returns all Pod IPs (not a single VIP)
```

---

## üåê Service DNS

Kubernetes has an internal **DNS server** (CoreDNS) that maps services and pods.

DNS Naming Format:

```
<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
```

Example:

```bash
ping my-service.default.svc.cluster.local
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Selectors & Endpoints

* Services use **label selectors** to find Pods.
* Kube-proxy updates the **Endpoints** resource with matching Pod IPs.

```yaml
selector:
  app: myapp
```

Endpoints example:

```yaml
subsets:
  addresses:
    - ip: 10.0.0.5
    - ip: 10.0.0.6
```

---

## üîÅ Session Affinity (Sticky Sessions)

By default, traffic is round-robin. For sticky sessions:

```yaml
sessionAffinity: ClientIP
```

This ensures a client always hits the same Pod.

---

## üì§ External Traffic Policies

Configure how external traffic is routed:

```yaml
externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster  # default - traffic can go to any Node
externalTrafficPolicy: Local    # traffic goes only to local Node with Pod
```

`Local` preserves client IP.

---

## üìç Port Mapping Recap

| Field        | Description                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `port`       | Port exposed by the Service                         |
| `targetPort` | Port on the Pod (container)                         |
| `nodePort`   | Port on the Node (only for NodePort / LoadBalancer) |

---

## üì° Behind the Scenes: kube-proxy

Kube-proxy handles routing of service traffic. It watches Service/Endpoint objects and updates:

* **iptables** rules (older default)
* **IPVS** rules (better performance, scalable)

---

## üìã Real-World Use Cases

| Scenario                    | Service Type     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Backend communication       | ClusterIP        |
| Web app exposed to internet | LoadBalancer     |
| Access Pod from Node IP     | NodePort         |
| Legacy system integration   | ExternalName     |
| Stateful app discovery      | Headless Service |

---

## üß™ Troubleshooting

| Issue            | Tool                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Check Service    | `kubectl get svc`                           |
| Check Endpoints  | `kubectl get endpoints`                     |
| Debug traffic    | `kubectl exec -it <pod> -- curl <svc-name>` |
| DNS test         | `nslookup <svc-name>`                       |
| Describe details | `kubectl describe svc <name>`               |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

* Use **ClusterIP** for internal-only services.
* For external exposure, prefer **Ingress** over NodePort/LoadBalancer.
* **Avoid using hard-coded nodePorts**.
* **Enable health checks** and **readiness probes** on Pods.
* Use **Headless Service** for StatefulSets or direct Pod access.

### ‚úÖ 1. What are the different types of Kubernetes Services?

**Answer:**

Kubernetes supports **five main types of services**:

| Service Type         | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ClusterIP**        | Default service type. Exposes the service on an internal IP accessible only within the cluster.                        |
| **NodePort**         | Exposes the service on a static port on each Node's IP (external access via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`).                    |
| **LoadBalancer**     | Creates an external cloud load balancer to expose the service outside the cluster.                                     |
| **ExternalName**     | Maps the service to an external DNS name (no selector or Pods involved).                                               |
| **Headless Service** | Uses `clusterIP: None`, enabling direct access to Pods for use cases like StatefulSets or DNS-based service discovery. |

### ‚úÖ 2. How does a Service route traffic to a Pod?

**Answer:**

* The Service uses a **label selector** to identify matching Pods.
* The matching Pods‚Äô IPs are compiled into an **EndpointSlice** object.
* **kube-proxy** watches these Service and EndpointSlice objects.
* On each node, **kube-proxy** creates routing rules (using **iptables** or **IPVS**) that forward traffic from the Service IP/port to the appropriate Pod IP/port.

### ‚úÖ 3. What is the difference between ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer?

| Feature     | ClusterIP     | NodePort                  | LoadBalancer                     |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Visibility  | Internal only | External via Node IP      | External via cloud LB            |
| Port Access | ClusterIP     | NodeIP\:NodePort          | External LB IP or DNS            |
| Use Case    | Internal apps | Dev/test/limited external | Production-grade external access |

**Answer Summary:**

* **ClusterIP**: Used for internal communication between services.
* **NodePort**: Used for exposing services externally by opening a port on each node.
* **LoadBalancer**: Provisioned by cloud providers to expose services to the internet.

### ‚úÖ 4. How does DNS resolution work in Kubernetes?

**Answer:**

Kubernetes uses **CoreDNS** to provide internal DNS resolution for Services and Pods.

* Every service gets a DNS name in the format:

  ```
  <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
  ```
* When a Pod tries to access a service via its DNS name, **CoreDNS** resolves it to:

  * The **ClusterIP** of the service (normal service)
  * The **Pod IPs** (for Headless services)

üìñ Docs:
üëâ [DNS for Services and Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/)

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Explain a use case for a Headless Service.

**Answer:**

A **Headless Service** is useful when:

* You want direct access to each Pod without load-balancing.
* You‚Äôre using **StatefulSets** or **Databases** like Cassandra, where each Pod has a unique identity and DNS name.

It is configured with:

```yaml
clusterIP: None
```

üìñ Docs:
üëâ [Headless Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services)

**Example Use Case**:

* In Cassandra, each node (Pod) must be individually addressable for gossip protocols and replication. A Headless Service allows this via DNS resolution to individual Pod IPs.

---

### ‚úÖ 6. What is the role of kube-proxy?

**Answer:**

`kube-proxy` runs on each node and:

* Watches the Kubernetes API for Services and Endpoints.
* Creates **iptables** or **IPVS** rules that route incoming traffic to the appropriate backend Pods.
* Ensures that service traffic is load-balanced across healthy Pods.

üìñ Docs:
üëâ [kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-proxy)

---

### ‚úÖ 7. How can a client retain sticky sessions to a Pod?

**Answer:**

You can enable **Session Affinity** using the `sessionAffinity: ClientIP` field in the Service spec. This ensures that traffic from the same client IP always goes to the same backend Pod.

```yaml
spec:
  sessionAffinity: ClientIP
```

üìñ Docs:
üëâ [Session Affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#session-affinity)

---

### ‚úÖ 8. Why would you use `externalTrafficPolicy: Local`?

**Answer:**

Setting `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` on a Service:

* Preserves the **original client source IP**.
* Ensures traffic is only sent to **Pods on the same node** that received the traffic.

This is useful when:

* You need the client IP (e.g., for logging, authentication, geolocation).
* You are using ingress controllers or load balancers that require it.

```yaml
spec:
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
```
