# 🚀 Kubernetes Services – Detailed Notes

🔗 [Official Docs – Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)

---

## 🔹 1. What is a Kubernetes Service?

A **Service** in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a **logical set of Pods** and a policy by which to **access them**.

🔗 [What is a Service?](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#what-is-a-service)

---

## 🔹 2. Why are Services Needed?

| Need                             | How Service Helps               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Pods have dynamic IPs            | Service gives static IP         |
| Load balancing traffic           | Distributes traffic across pods |
| Easy pod discovery               | Uses DNS with CoreDNS           |
| External access to internal apps | NodePort/LoadBalancer/Ingress   |

## 🔹 3. Components of a Service

| Component     | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Selector**  | Filters which pods the service targets using labels                         |
| **Ports**     | Define the service port and the port on the Pod (`targetPort`)              |
| **Type**      | Controls the service's accessibility method (e.g., `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`) |
| **ClusterIP** | Virtual IP that routes traffic to matched Pods                              |
| **Endpoints** | Stores IP addresses of selected Pods                                        |

## 🔹 4. Types of Kubernetes Services

🔗 [Service Types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types)

---

### 📘 1. ClusterIP (default)

* Internal-only service.
* Used for **inter-pod** communication.

🔗 [ClusterIP](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#clusterip)

---

### 🌐 2. NodePort

* Exposes the service on a static port (30000–32767) on each Node.
* Useful for testing and development.

🔗 [NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport)

---

### ☁️ 3. LoadBalancer

* Provisions an external load balancer via cloud provider.
* Commonly used in production.

🔗 [LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer)

---

### 🌐 4. ExternalName

* Maps a Kubernetes service to an external DNS.

🔗 [ExternalName](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname)

---

### 🔍 5. Headless Service

* Service without a cluster IP (`clusterIP: None`).
* Used for stateful applications like databases.

🔗 [Headless Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services)

---

## 🔹 5. Service Discovery

### 🔁 DNS (CoreDNS)

Kubernetes automatically creates DNS records for services.

🔗 [Service DNS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/)

---

### 🔁 Environment Variables

Kubelet can inject service info into environment variables.

🔗 [Environment Variables for Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#environment-variables)

---

## 🔹 6. How Load Balancing Works

Kubernetes uses:

* `kube-proxy` (on every node)
* Implements routing via:

  * `iptables` (default)
  * `IPVS` (optional, faster)

🔗 [How Services Work](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#how-services-work)

🔗 [kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#kube-proxy)

## 🔹 7. Important Commands

| Command                                                        | Description                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `kubectl get svc`                                              | List all services              |
| `kubectl describe svc <service-name>`                          | View detailed info             |
| `kubectl get endpoints`                                        | List endpoints                 |
| `kubectl expose deployment myapp --port=80 --target-port=8080` | Create service from deployment |
| `kubectl port-forward svc/my-service 8080:80`                  | Port forward to access locally |

## 🔹 8. Diagram – How Services Work

```plaintext
+-----------------------------+
|       External Client       |
+-------------+---------------+
              |
       (LoadBalancer / NodePort)
              |
      +-------+--------+
      | Kubernetes Nodes|
      +-------+--------+
              |
         +----v----+
         | Service |
         +----+----+
              |
      +-------+--------+
      | Endpoints (Pods) |
      +--------+--------+
               |
      +--------v--------+
      | Pod A  | Pod B  | Pod C
      +--------+--------+
```

### ✅ Q4: What is a Headless Service?

**A:** A service with `clusterIP: None`. It returns the IPs of the pods directly (no load balancing). Useful for StatefulSets.

---

### ✅ Q5: How does kube-proxy help in Services?

**A:** It configures network rules (iptables/IPVS) to route traffic from the service IP to the backend pods (Endpoints).

---

### ✅ Q6: What is an Endpoint in Kubernetes?

**A:** It is a list of pod IP addresses associated with a Service based on label selectors.

---

### ✅ Q7: Can you create a Service without a selector?

**A:** Yes, in that case you must manually define the Endpoints.

---

### ✅ Q8: What happens when all pods behind a service are deleted?

**A:** The service still exists, but it has **no endpoints**, and thus cannot route traffic.
