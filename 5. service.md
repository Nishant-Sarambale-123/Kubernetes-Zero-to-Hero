# 🚀 Kubernetes Services – Detailed Notes

---

## 🔹 1. What is a Kubernetes Service?

In Kubernetes, a **Service** is an abstraction that defines a **logical group of Pods** and a way to **access them**.

### 📌 Problem Solved by Services:

* Pods have **ephemeral IPs** (change on restart).
* We need a **stable network identity** to connect reliably.
* Services solve this by providing:

  * A **fixed virtual IP (ClusterIP)**
  * A **DNS name**
  * **Load balancing** across matching pods

---

## 🔹 2. Why are Services Needed?

| Need                             | How Service Helps               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Pods have dynamic IPs            | Service gives static IP         |
| Load balancing traffic           | Distributes traffic across pods |
| Easy pod discovery               | Uses DNS with CoreDNS           |
| External access to internal apps | NodePort/LoadBalancer/Ingress   |

---

## 🔹 3. Components of a Service

| Component     | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Selector**  | Filters which pods the service targets using labels                         |
| **Ports**     | Define the service port and the port on the Pod (`targetPort`)              |
| **Type**      | Controls the service's accessibility method (e.g., `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`) |
| **ClusterIP** | Virtual IP that routes traffic to matched Pods                              |
| **Endpoints** | Stores IP addresses of selected Pods                                        |

---

## 🔹 4. Types of Kubernetes Services

---

### 📘 1. ClusterIP (default)

* Internal-only service (no external access).
* Used for **inter-pod** communication.

**YAML Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

---

### 🌐 2. NodePort

* Exposes the service on a static **port (30000–32767)** on each Node.
* Access: `http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`

**Use Case**: Development/testing on bare-metal clusters.

**YAML Example:**

```yaml
type: NodePort
ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 30036
```

---

### ☁️ 3. LoadBalancer

* Provisions an **external load balancer** from cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
* Access: `http://<External-LB-IP>`

**Use Case**: Production workloads in the cloud.

**YAML Example:**

```yaml
type: LoadBalancer
ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

---

### 🌐 4. ExternalName

* Maps a service to an **external DNS name**.

**Use Case**: Connect to services outside the cluster like `db.example.com`.

**YAML Example:**

```yaml
type: ExternalName
externalName: db.example.com
```

---

### 🔍 5. Headless Service (`ClusterIP: None`)

* No load balancing or virtual IP.
* Returns the IP addresses of Pods directly.
* Enables **stateful applications** (like databases) to be addressed by hostname.

**YAML Example:**

```yaml
clusterIP: None
```

---

## 🔹 5. Service Discovery

### 🔁 DNS (via CoreDNS):

* Kubernetes automatically creates DNS records for Services.
* Format: `<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`

🔎 Example:

```bash
ping backend-service.default.svc.cluster.local
```

### 🔁 Environment Variables:

Kubelet injects service details into environment variables of every pod at startup (less used today).

---

## 🔹 6. How Load Balancing Works

Kubernetes uses:

* **kube-proxy** (runs on each node)
* It uses either:

  * `iptables` (default) → packet forwarding
  * `IPVS` (more performant alternative)

Kube-proxy reads Service and Endpoint objects and sets up network rules to forward requests to one of the pods behind a service.

## 🔹 7. Important Commands

| Command                                                        | Description                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `kubectl get svc`                                              | List all services                  |
| `kubectl describe svc <service-name>`                          | View detailed info about a service |
| `kubectl get endpoints`                                        | List endpoints of services         |
| `kubectl expose deployment myapp --port=80 --target-port=8080` | Create service                     |
| `kubectl port-forward svc/my-service 8080:80`                  | Access service locally             |

## 🔹 9. Interview Questions & Answers

### ✅ Q1: What is a Service in Kubernetes?

**A:** A Kubernetes Service provides a stable endpoint (IP + DNS) to access a group of dynamically created Pods.

---

### ✅ Q2: What are the types of Kubernetes Services?

**A:**

1. ClusterIP (default)
2. NodePort
3. LoadBalancer
4. ExternalName
5. Headless

---

### ✅ Q3: What’s the difference between ClusterIP and NodePort?

| Feature   | ClusterIP           | NodePort                   |
| --------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Scope     | Internal to cluster | Accessible outside cluster |
| Port type | Virtual IP          | Static port on node        |
| Use case  | Inter-service       | Testing, limited external  |

---

### ✅ Q4: What is a Headless Service?

**A:** A service with `clusterIP: None`. It returns the IPs of the pods directly (no load balancing). Useful for StatefulSets.

---

### ✅ Q5: How does kube-proxy help in Services?

**A:** It configures network rules (iptables/IPVS) to route traffic from the service IP to the backend pods (Endpoints).

---

### ✅ Q6: What is an Endpoint in Kubernetes?

**A:** It is a list of pod IP addresses associated with a Service based on label selectors.

---

### ✅ Q7: Can you create a Service without a selector?

**A:** Yes, in that case you must manually define the Endpoints.

---

### ✅ Q8: What happens when all pods behind a service are deleted?

**A:** The service still exists, but it has **no endpoints**, and thus cannot route traffic.
